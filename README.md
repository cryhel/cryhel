# Hi there, I'm cryhel! 🚀  

I’m a blockchain enthusiast, validator, and part-time server whisperer. With over 3 years of experience, I specialize in keeping nodes happy, healthy, and running like clockwork. My mission? To support decentralization and make sure the blockchain never skips a beat.  

## What I Do:  
- ⚙️ Spin up nodes in ecosystems like **Cosmos**, **Polkadot**, and **Ethereum** faster than you can say "proof-of-stake."  
- 🛠️ Tame Linux servers (Ubuntu, Docker) and turn chaos into order.  
- 📜 Write Bash and Python scripts that make my nodes—and my life—run smoother.  
- 🔐 Fortify nodes with security setups like Fail2Ban, Nginx, and a healthy dose of paranoia.  

## Fun Facts:
- 🌐 I’ve probably spent more time monitoring servers than watching Netflix.  
- 🧩 If troubleshooting was an Olympic sport, I’d be a gold medalist.  
- 🐧 I prefer Linux over Windows—because who doesn’t love a good terminal?
